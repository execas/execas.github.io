## Avoiding spam, malware and phishing

Spam, malware and phishing is something all system administrators (and end users) have become familiar with.

Email is a powerful advertising tool and an excellent attack vector. It's estimated that around 90% of all email messages sent, are unwanted. 

The *Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report (2018)* states that:

  - more than 90% of breaches start with phishing, almost exclusively done through email.
  - the frequency of malware vectors are 92.4% email, 6.3% web and 1.3% other.


Is it effective to protect your email adresses, by for example not publishing contact lists online? Yes, but this is far from enough to  


### Spam

Spam is garbage mail like unsolicited advertising and scam emails.

Spam can be dealt with by using a cloud anti-spam service, running an anti-spam gateway, using anti-spam software on the email servers or using anti-spam tools on the clients.

A **cloud anti-spam service** will scan incoming (and often outgoing) emails and remove or quarantine spam. 
A portal is often available for the customer, where they can get an overview, release false positives, tune the detection, whitelist and blacklist, and schedule reports.
Cloud anti-spam services will typically not require any hardware or software, but requires a change in the DNS MX record and probably some light firewall configuration.

> Many cloud anti-spam services also offer end-user digest emails where users can release (safe) blocked emails addressed to them, freeing up a lot of time for administrators.

An **anti-spam gateway** does much of the same as the service of the cloud anti-spam provider. In fact, a lot of providers base their service on well-known open source or proprietary email gateways.
The gateway comes as software, a virtual appliance or as a hardware appliance. Using a both a cloud anti-spam service and an onsite anti-spam gateway is not very common.

**Anti-spam software** for email servers is typically installed onto the email server. The installed agent can often monitor inbound, outbound and internal transport, as well as perform real-time and scheduled scanning of the storage.

**Anti-spam tools** for clients may be part of the email client, or installed as a third party software. This is the last line of defense (apart from the user's awareness, which should never be trusted).

Combining some of these countermeasures - *layered security* - will of course result in a more effective protection.


### Malware

Malware is malicious software like trojans, worms and viruses (and cryptoviruses).

Most of the *anti-spam* countermeasures mentioned above, will also scan for malware.

A **cloud anti-spam service** can often scan email attachments and URL's to find harmful files or sites that spread malware.

> Some cloud anti-spam services also perform URL rewrites: when the user opens a URL in an email, the contents are first scanned in a cloud sandbox, and then the user is granted or denied access.
> If URLs are only checked as the email comes in, the content can be harmless and the changed to something at a later time.

An **anti-spam gateway** can often perform malware scanning on the emails passing trough it, typically just attachments.

**Anti-spam software** for email servers can often scan both email transport and email storage for malware.

**Anti-spam tools** for clients is often part of a full-fledged anti-malware solution. As the last line of defense, these solutions should contain advanced detection capabilities such as behavioral analysis (to detect new malware), and have a central management for visibility, reporting and configuration.

Again, combining some of these countermeasures - *layered security* - will of course result in a more effective protection.
