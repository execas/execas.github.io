## Avoiding spam and malware


### Spam

Spam is garbage mail like unsolicited advertising and scam emails.

Spam can be dealt with by using a cloud anti-spam provider, running an anti-spam gateway, using anti-spam software on the email servers or using anti-spam tools on the clients.

A cloud anti-spam provider will scan incoming (and often outgoing) emails and remove or quarantine spam. 
A portal is often available for the customer, where they can get an overview, release false positives, tune the detection, whitelist and blacklist, and schedule reports.
Cloud anti-spam services will typically not require any hardware or software, but requires a change in the DNS MX record and probably some light firewall configuration.

> Many cloud anti-spam services also offer end-user digest emails where users can release (safe) blocked emails addressed to them, freeing up a lot of time for administrators.

An anti-spam gateway does much of the same as the service of the cloud anti-spam provider. In fact, a lot of providers base their service on well-known open source or proprietary email gateways.
The gateway comes as software, pre-configured virtual machines or as a box.

Combining some of these countermeasures will of course result in an increased effect.
